# Pork
A project to efficently reset Minecraft seeds with opencv for speedrunning purposes.

This project is meant to be used along side [Specnr's Wall project](https://github.com/Specnr/MultiResetWall).\
As of now, there is no proper integration between the two and Pork handles resets through control of the mouse.

Pork was built with a standard 1920x1080 resolution and 3x3 instance setup in mind.\
Any other configurations cannot be guaranteed to work.

### Technologies Used
- Rust
- Opencv
